This is a really simple package manager that uses either gz compression or no compression. It demonstrates the basics of a package manager.

Please note, this program will *not* install anything on your system unless you change the variable "DangerMode" to true in main.c

Also note, you can find a couple example packages to install/tinker with in example-packages/

Have fun!
